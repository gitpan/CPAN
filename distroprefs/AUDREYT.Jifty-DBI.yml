  recently released version by SARTAK probably does not need the patch
  anymore? I put it into regular MI.yml

match:
  distribution: "^AUDREYT/Jifty-DBI-"
pl:
  env:
    PERL_AUTOINSTALL: --skip
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 5
    talk:
      - "Auto-install"
      - "y\n"
make:
  env:
    PERL_AUTOINSTALL: --skip
patches:
  - "ANDK/Module-AutoInstall-in-inc-ANDK-01.patch"
