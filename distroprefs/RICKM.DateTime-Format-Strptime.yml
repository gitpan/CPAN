  started failing on 2008-05-19 with 'Can't call method "year" on an
  undefined value at t/004_locale_defaults.t line 45.' while testing a
  french date in december 1998 with a date containing

    DB<8> Dump $_->[2]
  SV = PV(0xe699f8) at 0x116cf70
    REFCNT = 1
    FLAGS = (POK,pPOK)
    PV = 0x118d100 "31 d\351c 1998"\0
    CUR = 11
    LEN = 16

  did already have a period of fails between 2007-12-30 and 2008-01-13
  but that time was due to a DateTime failure, not a ->year deficiency.

  changing the file to contain utf8 instead of latin1 and adding a use
  utf8 does not solve the problem. Is it a dependeny regression?

  'requires' => {
                  'DateTime' => '0.1402',
                  'DateTime::Locale' => '0.35',
                  'DateTime::TimeZone' => '0.25',
                  'Params::Validate' => '0.64'
                }

  Why do I only see two fails with getreports? cpantesters bug report
  sent to Robert Spier. getreports must get a switch
  --cpantesters-format=yaml and then iterate over that array with the
  first appearance is release date proxy.

  Why can't David Cantrell's server find out dependencies?
