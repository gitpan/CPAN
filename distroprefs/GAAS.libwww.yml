  6.x requires perl 5.8.8

  For 5.8.1 I had to install URI-1.40 first and then 5.834 did not
  work and 5.830 did not work and 5.820 DID work.

match:
  distribution: "^GAAS/libwww-perl-6"
  perlconfig:
    version: '^5\.8\.[0-7]'
goto: GAAS/libwww-perl-5.834.tar.gz

  A -n once asked no questions and took default values

  Some day it changed to mean: do not install the EXE_FILES

match:
  distribution: "^GAAS/libwww-perl-5"
pl: 
  args:
    - "-n"
  expect: 
    - "Do you want to enable these tests"
    - "n\n"
