    Lots of packages depend indirectly on this.

    If I answer y to all questions then I even get JSON::PC as a
    dependency which means asking for trouble. Would they really
    depend on all 4 differrent JSON packages then I'd rather call it
    JSON::All, not Any. So the eexpect stanza gets a bit complicated.

    Would be a good test candidate to train for optional_features.

match:
  distribution: 'RBERJON/JSON-Any-\d'
depends:
  requires:
    JSON: 0
    JSON::XS: 0
pl:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 60
    reuse: 1
    talk:
      - '\[JSON::PC\][^\]]+Auto-install'
      - "n\n"
      - "Auto-install"
      - "y\n"
# for very old bundled AutoInstall:
      - "Do you wish to install"
      - "y\n"
