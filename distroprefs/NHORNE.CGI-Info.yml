  Note: the mentioned
  http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/aac8f49a-4e2b-11e1b114-38629aeef8c6
  does not exist.

  It seems this specific test is really widespread. Can it be stopped?

  Not at the moment, because Test::Kwalitee itself currently fails due
  to Module::CPANTS::Analyse=>Module::ExtractUse (#74879) and since
  v5.15.6-559-g604a99b due to defined(@array) somewhere else.

  7585{0,1} find the test also in NEELY/Data-Serializer-0.59.tar.gz

match:
  distribution: '(?:NHORNE|VPIT)/'
#depends:
#  requires:
#    Test::Kwalitee: 0
