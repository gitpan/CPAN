   Disabled because it downloads the entire wx something every time
   it's called.

   Update 2008-05: This seems to be fixed when one answers no to "Do
   you want to build..."

match:
  distribution: 'MBARBON/Alien-wxWidgets-\d'
pl:
  expect:
    - "Do you want to build wxWidgets"
    - "n\n"

match:
  distribution: 'MBARBON/Wx-\d'
test:
  env:
    DISPLAY: ":121"
