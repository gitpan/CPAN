  Author would prefer to never see false positives which I cannot
  guarantee, so we turn off mails for him completely. Main involvement
  was Digest::SHA which got FAILs during a short phase of 5.9.3 due to
  some broken headerfiles in these bleadperls. A better solution than
  disabling reports would be configure stuff that probes for the
  signature of Newz (or was it Newx?)

  I had a good email exchange with Mark and so I rediscovered the
  cpanconfig/test_report distropref setting which I had already
  forgotten.
