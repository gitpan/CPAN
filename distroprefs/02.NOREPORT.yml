  In general nobody wants to see reports about 5.[79] anymore

  But then on 2009-01-14 my smoker sent this:
  http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/01/msg3068489.html
  which I cannot explain why. CPAN.pm was 1.9205, did it not implement
  the construct? CPAN::Reporter was 1.13. Cannot reproduce (but did
  not try very hard)

match:
  perlconfig:
    version: '^5\.[79]'
cpanconfig:
  test_report: 0

  Author would prefer to never see false positives which I cannot
  guarantee, so we turn off mails for him completely. Main involvement
  was Digest::SHA which got FAILs during a short phase of 5.9.3 due to
  some broken headerfiles in these bleadperls. A better solution than
  disabling reports would be configure stuff that probes for the
  signature of Newz (or was it Newx?)

  I had a good email exchange with Mark and so I rediscovered the
  cpanconfig/test_report distropref setting which I had already
  forgotten.

  BARBIE: opt out. Barbie does not want time-in-the-future errors
