  It seems that gnome-dev must be installed but I do not want to
  install it because it depends on (for me) broken libdb 4.6.

  Maybe I should set to disabled instead? No, because once this
  package gives me something without insisting on gnome-dev, it may
  start working for me.

match:
  distribution: "MLEHMANN/Gtk-Perl-\d"
pl:
  args:
    - "--without-pkgname=gnome"
