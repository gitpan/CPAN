  Warning: this distroprefs file was only needed for a binary search
  today (2007-10-21) between 28381 and current blead. At some point
  the glibc noise that accompaniied 28381 disappeared again and we had
  to determine the patch that fixed the glibc noise. 28969 did it.

  But between 28969 and 32152 there is another break between
  32014/32015. 32014 does not break on 10-simple but 32015 does.

  In fact 32014 did not break on any of the tests and 32015 breaks
  *only* on 10-simple.t

match:
  distribution: "VPIT/Variable-Magic-0.04.tar.gz"
#test:
#  args:
#    - "TEST_FILES=t/10-simple.t"
