  Because the Makefile.PL depends on having DBI installed we want to
  let them build DBI and then rerun perl Makefile.PL and then make"

  It's a crazy example that I do not really like. I prefer resolving
  such a thing with a build_requires or similar mechanism and see it
  as a Todo item that such hacks are not needed in the future.

match:
  distribution: "^MSERGEANT/DBD-SQLite-1\.13\.tar\.gz"
make:
  commandline: "$PERL Makefile.PL; make"
