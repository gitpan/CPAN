    Currently does not work for me for cpantesters. For some reason
    Test::Reporter does not set the From address when Mail::Send is
    being used but does so when Net::SMTP is being used.

    update 2007-07-21: Found a way to disable Mail::Send in
    Test::Reporter with a patch, so now I do not need to disable
    MailTools anymore.

match:
  distribution: "^MARKOV/MailTools-\d"
# disabled: 1
