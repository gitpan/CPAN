  ***** WARNING! *****

  Whoa there! We found JSON::RPC (0.96) in your system.
  If you have code that relies on this previous version, DO NOT UPGRADE.

  JSON::RPC has been re-written and re-worked. It's a completely different
  code base now, and because the old code pre dates PSGI/Plack, we figured
  it was not worth making things API compatible. So if you have code
  that uses this old code and upgrade, YOUR CODE WILL BREAK!

  If you are sure you want to upgrade, be my guest.

  Really upgrade? (y/n) [n] 

match:
  distribution: '^DMAKI/JSON-RPC-1\.'
pl:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    talk:
      - "Really upgrade"
      - "y\n"
