  hanging test reporte in RT

  The test is not really interactive but we treat is like an
  interactive one to have Expect care for the timeout and kill.

  But the result looks like a bug to me:

  t/mojolicious/upload_lite_app.t ............... ok
  t/mojolicious/websocket_lite_app.t ............ We won't be doing any rendezvous publishing, please install a Net::Rendezvous::Publish::Backend:: module
  t/mojolicious/websocket_lite_app.t ............ 1/29 Failing: could not answer a question during the dialog                                                     
    KRAIH/Mojolicious-0.999941.tar.gz
    /usr/bin/make test -- OK
  Running make install

  This tells me we are interrupting the test and counting it as a PASS!!!

  Eeeek

match:
  distribution: "KRAIH/Mojolicious-0.999941.tar.gz"
test:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 600
    reuse: 1
    talk:
      - "-- OK"
      - "\n"
