  I don't know if it is documented. From skimming the Makefile.PL it
  seems the way to specify that we want mod_perl 1.

  But at least three times it failed: ../nntp-testers/1191783
  ../nntp-testers/1107548 ../nntp-testers/1098969, all three in March
  2008, with 5.10.0@33542, 33412, 33411. OK, I did it wrong. They want
  MOD_PERL=1 and they want mod_perl already installed as a
  configure_requires.

  I've submitted a patch to RT which I do not need myself because
  configure_requires should do.

  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34316

match:
  distribution: 'PHRED/Apache-Reload-\d'
pl:
  args:
    - "MOD_PERL=1"
depends:
  configure_requires:
    mod_perl: 1
