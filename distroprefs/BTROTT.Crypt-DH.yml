  Math::BigInt seems to take infinitely long to compute this test to
  an end. Only if Math::BigInt::GMP is installed, this test is
  computed in a few seconds. Last time verified with Crypt-DH-0.06 and
  Math::BigInt 1.86.

  As Math::BigInt::GMP 1.21 fails a test I used 1.20 as a fallback

match:
  distribution: "^BTROTT/Crypt-DH-"
  perl: ".../installed-perls/..."
disabled: 1
