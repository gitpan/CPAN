  If I run the test 03client.t often enough manually I found it
  hanging from time to time. That's why I used a patched test before
  2.7 was available.

  Since 2.7 does not use EV as first choice it never hangs and I can
  comment this patch out because nowadays I want to use 2.6 as a
  testbed for future EV versions.

match:
  distribution: "^MLEHMANN/AnyEvent-2.6.tar.gz"
test:
  env:
    DISPLAY: ":121"
    PERL_ANYEVENT_VERBOSE: 2
depends:
  configure_requires:
    Event: 0
  requires:
    Event: 0
# patches:
#   - "ANDK/patches/AnyEvent-2.6-ANDK-01.patch.gz"
