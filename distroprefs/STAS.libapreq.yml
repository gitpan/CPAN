  Note: it was libapreq-1.33 which died during 'perl Makefile.PL' if
  mod_perl was missing, so it is really a configure_requires, not a
  simple requires

match:
  distribution: "^(STAS|GEOFF)/libapreq-\d"
pl:
  args:
    - "-httpd"
    - "/home/src/www/apache/apachebin/1.3.37/bin/httpd"
depends:
  configure_requires:
    mod_perl: 1.30
  requires:
    mod_perl: 1.30
