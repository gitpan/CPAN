  I do not believe these should all be handled as configure_requires
  but they refuse to talk their dialog unless all prereqs are
  fulfilled, so from the user's pov they are "configure_requires".

match:
  distribution: "^BRIANSKI/XML-Comma-"
make:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 5
    talk:
      - "XML::Comma comma_root"
      - "/usr/local/comma\n"
      - "mysql host"
      - "localhost\n"
      - "mysql database name"
      - "comma\n"
      - "mysql user"
      - "comma\n"
      - "mysql password"
      - "comma\n"
      - "extra DSN parameters"
      - "mysql_socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock\n"

  not sure why I wrote the eexpect into a make stanza first...

match:
  distribution: "^BRIANSKI/Proc-Exists-"
make:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 5
    talk:
      - "forego XS"
      - "no\n"
pl:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 5
    talk:
      - "forego XS"
      - "no\n"
