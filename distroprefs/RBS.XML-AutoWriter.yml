  And currently XML::Parser tests hang with @17384 even if I upgrade
  to IO::File: 1.14

  So I rebuilt 17637 and got a working XML::Parser.

  I then rewrote the binary search because RBS/XML-AutoWriter-0.39
  comes with 0.38.

match:
  distribution: 'RBS/XML-AutoWriter-\d'
depends:
  requires:
    XML::Parser: 0
