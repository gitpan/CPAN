  if graph not installed then the test Assembly/ContigSpectrum.t is skipped which is a pity

match:
  distribution: 'CJFIELDS/BioPerl-\d'
pl:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 15
    reuse: 1
    talk:
      - 'Install \[a\]ll BioPerl scripts'
      - "a\n"
      - 'Do you want to run tests that require connection to servers across the internet'
      - "n\n"
depends:
