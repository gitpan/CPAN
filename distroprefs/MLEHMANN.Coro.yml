  or just to accept defaults in future releases...

  The dependency on Event is only given because I want to build
  Coro::Event and it does not get built if Event is not installed
  BEFOREHAND.

  Starting with 4.02 the defaults stopped working for me and I needed
  CORO_INTERFACE=s. I discovered this only when we reached 4.13 and
  only for perls with debugging on (-Doptimize=-g)

match:
  distribution: "^MLEHMANN/Coro-"
  perlconfig:
    optimize: "-g"
pl:
  env:
    PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT: 1
    CORO_INTERFACE: s
depends:
  configure_requires:
    Event: 0
  requires:
    Event: 0
