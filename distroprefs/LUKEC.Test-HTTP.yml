  PREREQ_FATAL=0 on the commandline probably never worked, maybe I had
  a private copy of MakeMaker that supported it. Ticket 24774 has a
  patch for it. Trying with commandline instead.

match:
  distribution: "LUKEC/Test-HTTP-0.16.tar.gz"
cpanconfig:
  test_report: 0
pl:
  commandline: "$PERL -i~ -ne 'print unless /PREREQ_FATAL/' Makefile.PL; $PERL Makefile.PL"
