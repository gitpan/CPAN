  Writing "3" because the author promised in
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=33579 that the "4" will do
  it right.

  The bug here is that he tries interactivity during testing and
  Test::Harness eats everything. So only confirmation is possible by
  setting PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT.

match:
  distribution: "CRISB/WWW-Curl-3"
test:
  env:
    PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT: 1
