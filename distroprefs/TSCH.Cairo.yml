  Why do some people believe that dieing is the appropariate way to
  proceed whan just a dependency is not fulfilled?

match:
  distribution: "^TSCH/Cairo-\d"
depends:
  configure_requires:
    ExtUtils::PkgConfig: 0
    ExtUtils::Depends: 0
  requires:
    Test::Number::Delta: 0
pl:
  args:
    - "PREREQ_FATAL=0"
