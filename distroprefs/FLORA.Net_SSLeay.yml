  With 312{35,38} it started to hang completely.

    Increasing the timeout because the "Auto-install" question will
    often not arrive because we have installed everything already. So
    then we must see the EOF otherwise we will believe we could not
    answer a question.

match:
  distribution: "^FLORA/Net-SSLeay-\d"
pl:
  &pl_or_make
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 60
    reuse: 1
    talk:
      - "\QThese tests *will* *fail* if you do not have network connectivity\E"
      - "n\n"
      - "Auto-install"
      - "y\n"
  env:
    PERL_AUTOINSTALL: --skip    
    PERL_EXTUTILS_AUTOINSTALL: --skip
make:
  *pl_or_make
