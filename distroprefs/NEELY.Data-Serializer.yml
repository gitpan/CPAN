  Too many PASSes when these dependencies are not there because then
  tests are skipped.

  update 2008-03-29 akoenig : JSON 2 seems to be the main contributor
  to the fails that recently started to show up. (just an hypothesis)

match:
  distribution: 'NEELY/Data-Serializer-\d'
depends:
  requires:
    Digest::MD5: 0
    Digest::SHA1: 0
    Digest::SHA: 0
    Crypt::Blowfish: 0
    Crypt::CBC: 0
    JSON: 2
