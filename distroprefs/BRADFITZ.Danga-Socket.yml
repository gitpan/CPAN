  #17725 removed pseudo hashes from the core

  I also tried a second solution: Class::PseudoHash but it did not
  seem to work.

  2007-12-22 ak: I do not like the patch I supplied anymore. It
  disables FAIL reports and gets no attention from the maintainer.
  Commenting out today.

match:
  distribution: "BRADFITZ/Danga-Socket-1.5[67].tar.gz"
  perlconfig:
    version: "^(5\.10|5.9)"
#patches:
