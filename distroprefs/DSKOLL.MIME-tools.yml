  bleadperl probably broke this distro with undef in %INC; needs
  further investigation (2007-04)

  Warning: Use of "require" without parentheses is ambiguous at (eval 641) line 1.

  The bug seems to be in Mail::Field but is worked around by makeing
  sure Date::Format is installed.

  So I put the depends also into MARKOV.MailTools.yml

match:
  distribution: '^DSKOLL/MIME-tools-\d'
depends:
  requires:
    Date::Format: 0
