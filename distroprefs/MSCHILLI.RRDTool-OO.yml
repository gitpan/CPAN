  BTW, I then found out that RRDs.pm is missing and that it is not
  distributed separately. So either we get RRDs.pm from somewhere or
  we let him download and built rrdtools again and again. Or we fix
  the problem by providing out local copy (which presumeably needs
  patching, I haven't checked)

match:
  distribution: 'MSCHILLI/RRDTool-OO-\d'
pl:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 10
    talk:
      - "Do you want me to install it for you right now"
      - "n\n"
