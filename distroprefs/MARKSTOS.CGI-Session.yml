  At the time of this writing 4.20 fails as miserably as 4.20_1. I
  only wrote this file to have a reminder.

  ALERT! Broken! When the target of a goto does not succeed, there is
  the chance to loop endlessly.

# match:
#   distribution: "^MARKSTOS/CGI-Session-4.20.tar.gz"
# goto: "MARKSTOS/CGI-Session-4.20_1.tar.gz"
