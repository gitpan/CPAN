  I'd rather change the defaults to yes but mech is failing too often;
  the first 24 days of 2009-01 alone have 18 FAILs.

match:
  distribution: 'KARMAN/SWISH-Prog-\d'
pl:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 15
    talk:
      - "WWW::Mechanize is recommended. Add it to CPAN install list"
      - "n\n"
      - "Mail::Box is optional. Add it to CPAN install list"
      - "n\n"
