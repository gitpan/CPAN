  does not compile with bleadperl at all

  compiles with 5.8.9-tobe (33736)

  was in 01DISABLE for a while with "hangs early" but it didn't hang
  for me with 33736.

  But it failed the memleak test and it has not been updated since
  2003. How can Egg::Release depend on it and still have green? I did
  send a PASS for Egg::Release althoughPersistentPerl was missing.
  Strange.

match:
  distribution: 'HORROCKS/PersistentPerl-\d'
pl:
  expect:
    - "Compile mod_persistentperl"
    - "n\n"
