  The patch is nearly as broken as the original. The original runs
  into an endless loop without a httpd. The patch brings us an OK/PASS
  because it somehow leads to an empty variable TEST_FILES which means
  as much as "we have no tests". Weird. I hope to revisit this some
  day, for now I'm happy to have the endless loop banned. If you read
  this and have ideas, please step forward:)
