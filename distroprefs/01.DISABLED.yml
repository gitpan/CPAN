  Various reasons

  things that hang

  things that have too interactive tests, that cannot be easily
  automated

  things that need ressources we don't have

  or W:M:Pluggable kills the cpan shell with kill(); I don't understand how

  or Shell-GetEnv 0.0[23] threw me into a shell to sit there doing nothing

  or the tacacs thing seems to hang

  ObjEditor: http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29559

  etc.
