  Various reasons

  things that hang

  things that have too interactive tests, that cannot be easily
  automated

  things that need ressources we don't have

  2007-12-02 akoenig: removed ADAMK/Module-Install-\d from the list of
  banned modules. Unfortunately some authors declare it as a prereq. I
  know it is not meant to be installed but I cannot stop other people
  declare it as prereq. So If I refuse toe install it, something else
  cannot be installed. So I give up resistance. The original reason
  was that it was repeatedly leading to behaviour that I could not
  explain. I'll have to deal with that.
