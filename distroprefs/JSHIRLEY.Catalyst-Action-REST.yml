  because Data-Taxi has disappeared from CPAN (uploaded 2003, not
  found 2008-10) I must not confirm when it is offered as a dependency

match:
  distribution: '(JSHIRLEY|.+)/Catalyst-Action-REST-\d'
pl:
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 60
    reuse: 1
    talk:
      - "Taxi(?s:.+)Auto-install"
      - "n\n"
      - "Auto-install"
      - "n\n"
