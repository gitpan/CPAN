  Maybe prefer JS_INC or JS_LIB or JS_THREADSAFE or JS_UTF8 or JS_ENABLE_E4X

  It seems without JS_LIB goes nothing. The whole Debian setup is hard
  to understand: they have both mozjs and smjs and somehow they match
  and somehow not. Maybe they conflict without declaring it?

  This patch amended the Makefile.PL but not the other problems
