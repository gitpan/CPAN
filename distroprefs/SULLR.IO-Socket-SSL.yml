  WARNING
  No library for handling international domain names found.
  It will work but croak if you try to verify an international name against
  a certificate.
  It's recommended to install either Net::IDN::Encode, Net::LibIDN or URI version>=1.50
  
  Should I do external tests?
  These tests will fail if there is no internet connection or if a firewall
  blocks some traffic, does SSL interception or if a HTTP proxy is needed.
