	* bugfix: more checks after lynx if the command was successful or not

	* Ongoing heavy refactoring of FirstTime, currently still without
	becoming visible to the user (Jim Cromie)

	* More tests for CPAN::Version with output comparing the results with
	Sort::Versions and version.pm

	* bugfix: double check the "later" attribute before you excuse and unset
	it if it is obsolete; fixes a bug where a postponed distro could be lost
	from the queue

	* output of as_glimpse more space efficient

2006-01-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* bugfix rt #17131 (Lee Goddard): better error messages on two

	* release 1.83_53

	* bugfix: if we have no YAML and no Makefile, we could not determine
	prereqs. Now fixed by using Module::Build.

2006-01-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_51 brings

	* restructure FirstTime in a way to enable us to ask single questions RSN

	* envariable CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL now available for subshells (Slaven Rezic)

	* enable date/time warnings without the help of HTTP::Date (inspired by
	a bogus bugreport on perl monks that was only due to wrong system time)

	* bugfix: hide CPAN::Config from the indexer

	* provide a more traditional style ChangeLog and Changes file

2006-01-05  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.82 and 1.83 are quick bugfix releases.

2006-01-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.81 adds on top of 1.80_58:

	not mentioned in the index

	* include a hint that su might work as well as sudo in the dialog
	about make_install_make_command and mbuild_install_build_command

	* add Module::Signature to the Bundle and move Digest::SHA higher
	up so they start working as soon as possible

	* improve the dialog that ensues when bad signatures are
	encountered

2006-01-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_58 was a quick bugfix release

2005-12-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_57 adds on top of 1.80_56 the following:

	* prerequisites fixed: File::Temp was missing in PREREQ_PM and
	Bundle

	* reduce noise when $Debug is on

	* improved handling of whitespace in filenames (Roland Bauer;
	rt.cpan.org #3201)

	* add the Module::Build configuration parameters to the required
	parameters (thus users are relayed to the init dialog)

	* import less symbols

	* enhanced robustness if cwd gets removed while we're running
	(Rhet Turnbull; rt.cpan.org #321)

	* add "notest" to the completion table

	* enhanced robustness when untar is failing or poses permission
	problems

	* iron out some buglets in the "ls GLOB" code

	* enhanced robustness on "reload cpan" when the path to CPAN.pm
	has changed

	* replace some hash accesses with method calls for a cleaner
	interface (Work in Progress; no user-visible changes)

	* do not fail anymore when finding empty files left over from a
	previous unsuccessful download

	* uptodate message more descriptive (Adam Kennedy; rt.cpan.rg
	#15580)

2005-12-17  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_56 is a release candidate for 1.81

	* integrate release 1.5 of brian's cpan script from
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/brian-d-foy/

	* Support for Module::Build: to set the preference for
	Module::Build over MakeMaker, run

	  o conf prefer_installer MB
	  o conf commit

	* ls command supports globbing; these work nicely:

	  ls KWILLIAMS/P*
	  ls JV/make*

	this works too but is slow:

	  ls */*make*

	* META.yml data replace the Makefile parsing code if YAML
	available (compensating for the frequent wrong usage of the
	requires element)

	* support SHA256; stop using MD5

	* support bzip2 compression; can be tested with 'install
	ARTURAZ/Net-Vypress-Chat-0.72.1.tar.bz2'; the CPAN indexer does
	not yet index bz2 distros but will probably start to do so as soon
	as CPANPLUS supports bzip2

	* tiny tweaks to make CPAN.pm run on a busybox (Guillaume Filion)

	* bugfix: major speedup on all commands that need expansion of
	regular expressions to module names
	
	* prettier r command output: the 4th column of the 'r' command
	drops the redundant X/XX/ prefix

	* tolerant when you type one colon instead of two on module names

2005-12-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* this is release 1.80

	* support for Module::Signature courtesy Autrijus Tang

	* separated out new module CPAN::Version that has muchly improved
	support for multidot version notation that should make the
	deployment of version.pm easy for everybody. During the last weeks
	the indexer on PAUSE also got improved version.pm support and
	spits out numified versions. This release is optimized for the new
	version handling, regardless if used with or without version.pm
	(Thanks to John Peacock and to Graham Barr for their help)

	* new pragma 'notest' courtesy Slaven Rezic

	* support for sudo in the config variable
	'make_install_make_command' courtesy Michael Richardson

	* new commands 'recent' and 'perldoc' courtesy Toni Prug

	* improved wget support for Windows users courtesy Daniel

	* cleanup internal use of CPAN::Frontend courtesy David Storrs

	* fixes to distro bugs by Adriano Ferreira

	* runs under 5.004_05 courtesy Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni

	* new feature 'show_upload_date': if set to true, all 'm' and 'd'
	commands will display the upload date

	* fix bug in FirstTime causing endless loop under some conditions

	* better completion for config variables and a new warning if an
	unregistered config variable is being set

	* improved some error messages

	* improved help menu (Thanks to David Golden for the suggestion)
