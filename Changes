	* release 1.87_55

	* improve the heuristics when parsing PREREQ for scripts

	* document CPAN::Module::as_glimpse changes and fix the case where we
	have no author or no distro and added some tests for these cases

2006-07-23  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_54

	* fix #18165: new config option term_ornaments

	"disabled program"

2006-07-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87_53

	* make scripts installable when the path of the distro is given: you can
	now 'install ANDK/keepcool-0.344' and it is stored as 'keepcool'

	* the m command displays one column more: an equals sign if we have this
	version installed, a less-than sign if our installed version of the
	module is smaller and a space if we do not have this thing installed

	* fix #18438: weird dependency chain issue that broke
	amavis/SpamAssassin

	* fix #20168: when a user has neither Module::Signature nor gnupg, do
	not warn them

	* release 1.87_51

	* patch by Max Maischein to quote commands that contain spaces as is
	often the case on Windows systems (addresses #17877)

	* do not display DSLIP_STATUS when it is empty; same thing for MANPAGE

	* add a security advice to the manpage

	* do not advertise Bundle::CPAN when a new CPAN is available, CPAN alone
	should do

2006-02-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.87

	* new method dslip_status for Module objects

	* no t/dot-cpan/ directory in the distro anymore and removed after test

	* bugfix: when make clean failed, we did not list this as a fail

	* more tests in t/30shell.t, sub coverage on CPAN.pm now >75%

2006-02-23  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86_53
	
	* t/30shell emits two test headers (fixes #17816; Adam Kennedy)

	* make Tarzip work better on uncompressed files; fixes test failure of
	test t/12cpan.t work under some conditions

	* t/30shell now skips tests that need uninstalled prerequisites and so
	passes all tests on a bare 5.8.8 for me when CPAN_RUN_SHELL_TEST is set

2006-02-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86_52

	* simplification of the concepts of home and of the CPAN/MyConfig.pm and
	the CPAN/Config.pm. There were too many places that tried to do the same
	thing. Should now be centralized and consistent.

2006-02-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86_51

	* replace the concept of $ENV{HOME} with File::HomeDir (fixes #17759;
	Adam Kennedy)

	* remove a spurious CARRIAGE RETURN in the Todo file: it broke
	Module::Signature on Windows (fixes #17746; Adam Kennedy)

	* return empty string instead of undef when HAVE_MAKE is false (fixes
	#17768; Adam Kennedy)

	* do not try to use $CPAN::Frontend before it exists (fixes #17770; Adam
	Kennedy)

	* t/12cpan.t now behaves on 5.004 and 5.005
	
	* t/30shell.t now can be run without Expect; needs to be enabled with
	environment variable CPAN_RUN_SHELL_TEST in this case

	* more testing in 30shell.t

2006-02-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.86

	* quick fix for a bug in the Checksums checking code: if the cache had
	an old copy, it was in some cases not updated and if the file-to-check
	was newer, a false alarm was triggered.

	* I expect a 1.87 soonish, because we have open bugs: test 12cpan.t not
	suited for old perls; test for the above bug missing.

2006-02-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.85

	* Fix for 'install Bundle:CPAN' on Windows machines (closes #17699; Adam
	Kennedy)

	* Make a separate distro for Bundle::CPAN (works around the bug for
	older versions of CPAN)

	* Another fix for bundles: in some cases CPAN.pm installed an older
	bundle than the most recent

	* more tests: CPAN.pm subroutine coverage now at 71.4%

2006-02-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.84

	* see detailed release notes for releases 1.83_51 upto 1.83_69 below

	* highlights of the changes between 1.83 and 1.84: better error handling
	with new "failed" command and in many other places; new config variable
	ftp_passive is on by default; new command mkmyconfig; Module::Build
	support should now work on Windows and work better on all platforms; new
	methods for programmers CPAN::Module::distribution and
	CPAN::Distribution::author; improved docs; prettier output; and last not
	least a heavy dose of refactoring, bugfixing, and testing

	* Thanks to the bunch of helpful contributors and bug reporters (you
	know who you are:)

	* release 1.83_64 (potential release candidate for 1.84)

	* bugfix: when M:B specifies both requires AND build_requires AND then
	has no YAML to write the META.yml file, THEN we did not merge the two
	requiries. Seen in KCLARK/Text-RecordParser-v1.0.0.tar.gz.

	* release 1.83_62 came out today before this entry was written

	* rename the LC_ALL macro so that it does not infect the whole
	environment (Ken Williams)

	* new command mkmyconfig: patch supplied by Tyler MacDonald

2006-01-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_61

	* After a bugreport from Randy Kobes, another few small fixes to make
	sure that mbuild_install_build_command cannot make it through to be used
	anywhere.

	* release 1.83_60

	* bugfix: Do not use ./Build directly on Windows, it must be called
	together with the perl (fixes #17313; thanks to carl at fireartist for
	the report and a patch skeleton)

	* feature: 'o conf commit' now drops unknown config variables

	* bugfix for very rare cases: do not use CPAN::Distrostatus object
	methods on strings left over from the current session before a 'cpan

	* bugfix: better switches for the call to curl

	* bugfix: more checks after lynx if the command was successful or not

	* docs: revisited the FAQ section

	* bugfix: if a META.yml specified a prerequisite module that we do not

	* bugfix: honour build_requires

2006-01-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_58

	* command processor tweak on Win32 (Jan Dubois, Gisle Aas)

	* README production was broken

	* Ongoing heavy refactoring of FirstTime, currently still without
	becoming visible to the user (Jim Cromie)

	* More tests for CPAN::Version with output comparing the results with
	Sort::Versions and version.pm

	* bugfix: double check the "later" attribute before you excuse and unset
	it if it is obsolete; fixes a bug where a postponed distro could be lost
	from the queue

	* output of as_glimpse more space efficient

2006-01-19  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_57

	* bugfix rt #17131 (Lee Goddard): better error messages on two
	unrecoverable errors that require user intervention

	* shell.t improved again: now the output reads really similar to a shell

2006-01-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_54

	* conveniently handle $Config->{make} on systems that often switch
	between dmake and nmake, like ActiveState's perl (Gisle Aas)

	* better choice for command processor on Win32 (Gisle Aas)

	* newest cpan script (1.51) from brian d foy

	* "force ls" now refetches the CHECKSUMS files

	* shell.t now conforming to Test-Anything-Protocol and hopefully working
	on more platforms.

2006-01-12  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_53

	* bugfix: if we have no YAML and no Makefile, we could not determine
	prereqs. Now fixed by using Module::Build.
	
	* bugfix: b command on unpublished bundles was broken due to wrong

	dressage of the FirstTime. It actually contains shell.t.

2006-01-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.83_51 brings

	* restructure FirstTime in a way to enable us to ask single questions RSN
	(Jim Cromie)

	* shell.t that can test dialogues

	* envariable CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL now available for subshells (Slaven Rezic)

	* enable date/time warnings without the help of HTTP::Date (inspired by
	a bogus bugreport on perl monks that was only due to wrong system time)

	* bugfix: hide CPAN::Config from the indexer

	* provide a more traditional style ChangeLog and Changes file

2006-01-05  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.82 and 1.83 are quick bugfix releases.

2006-01-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.81 adds on top of 1.80_58:

	* bugfix: completion of debug options was not case insensitive

	* bugfix: installation of distributions was broken for distros
	not mentioned in the index

	* include a hint that su might work as well as sudo in the dialog
	about make_install_make_command and mbuild_install_build_command

	* add Module::Signature to the Bundle and move Digest::SHA higher
	up so they start working as soon as possible

	* improve the dialog that ensues when bad signatures are
	encountered

2006-01-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_58 was a quick bugfix release

2005-12-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_57 adds on top of 1.80_56 the following:

	* prerequisites fixed: File::Temp was missing in PREREQ_PM and
	Bundle

	* reduce noise when $Debug is on

	* improved handling of whitespace in filenames (Roland Bauer;
	rt.cpan.org #3201)

	* add the Module::Build configuration parameters to the required
	parameters (thus users are relayed to the init dialog)

	* import less symbols

	* enhanced robustness if cwd gets removed while we're running
	(Rhet Turnbull; rt.cpan.org #321)

	* add "notest" to the completion table

	* enhanced robustness when untar is failing or poses permission
	problems

	* iron out some buglets in the "ls GLOB" code

	* enhanced robustness on "reload cpan" when the path to CPAN.pm
	has changed

	* replace some hash accesses with method calls for a cleaner
	interface (Work in Progress; no user-visible changes)

	* do not fail anymore when finding empty files left over from a
	previous unsuccessful download

	* uptodate message more descriptive (Adam Kennedy; rt.cpan.rg
	#15580)

2005-12-17  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* release 1.80_56 is a release candidate for 1.81

	* integrate release 1.5 of brian's cpan script from
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/brian-d-foy/

	* Support for Module::Build: to set the preference for
	Module::Build over MakeMaker, run

	  o conf prefer_installer MB
	  o conf commit

	* ls command supports globbing; these work nicely:

	  ls KWILLIAMS/P*
	  ls JV/make*

	this works too but is slow:

	  ls */*make*

	* META.yml data replace the Makefile parsing code if YAML
	available (compensating for the frequent wrong usage of the
	requires element)

	* support SHA256; stop using MD5

	* support bzip2 compression; can be tested with 'install
	ARTURAZ/Net-Vypress-Chat-0.72.1.tar.bz2'; the CPAN indexer does
	not yet index bz2 distros but will probably start to do so as soon
	as CPANPLUS supports bzip2

	* tiny tweaks to make CPAN.pm run on a busybox (Guillaume Filion)

	* bugfix: major speedup on all commands that need expansion of
	regular expressions to module names
	
	* prettier r command output: the 4th column of the 'r' command
	drops the redundant X/XX/ prefix

	* tolerant when you type one colon instead of two on module names

2005-12-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* this is release 1.80

	* support for Module::Signature courtesy Autrijus Tang

	* separated out new module CPAN::Version that has muchly improved
	support for multidot version notation that should make the
	deployment of version.pm easy for everybody. During the last weeks
	the indexer on PAUSE also got improved version.pm support and
	spits out numified versions. This release is optimized for the new
	version handling, regardless if used with or without version.pm
	(Thanks to John Peacock and to Graham Barr for their help)

	* new pragma 'notest' courtesy Slaven Rezic

	* support for sudo in the config variable
	'make_install_make_command' courtesy Michael Richardson

	* new commands 'recent' and 'perldoc' courtesy Toni Prug

	* improved wget support for Windows users courtesy Daniel

	* cleanup internal use of CPAN::Frontend courtesy David Storrs

	* fixes to distro bugs by Adriano Ferreira

	* runs under 5.004_05 courtesy Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni

	* new feature 'show_upload_date': if set to true, all 'm' and 'd'
	commands will display the upload date

	* fix bug in FirstTime causing endless loop under some conditions

	* better completion for config variables and a new warning if an
	unregistered config variable is being set

	* improved some error messages

	* improved help menu (Thanks to David Golden for the suggestion)
