	* release 1.80_51

	* Support for Module::Build: to set the preference for
	Module::Build over MakeMaker, run

	  o conf prefer_installer MB
	  o conf commit

	* ls command supports globbing:

	  ls KWILLIAMS/P*
	and
	  ls JV/make*

	work nicely; even

	  ls */*make*

	works but this is, of course, very slow.

	* META.yml data replace the Makefile parsing code if YAML
	available

	* support SHA256; stop using MD5

	* support bzip2 compression; can be tested with 'install
	ARTURAZ/Net-Vypress-Chat-0.72.1.tar.bz2'; the CPAN indexer does
	not yet index bz2 distros

	* major speedup on all commands that need expansion of regular
	expressions to module names
	
	* prettier r command output: the 4th column of the 'r' command
	drops the redundant X/XX/ prefix

	* tolerant when you type one colon instead of two on module names

	* this is release 1.80

	* support for Module::Signature courtesy Autrijus Tang

	* separated out new module CPAN::Version that has muchly improved
	support for multidot version notation that should make the
	deployment of version.pm easy for everybody. During the last weeks
	the indexer on PAUSE also got improved version.pm support and
	spits out numified versions. This release is optimized for the new
	version handling, regardless if used with or without version.pm
	(Thanks to John Peacock and to Graham Barr for their help)
