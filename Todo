Provide something, so that the next "o conf commit" will not overwrite
the config file. maybe "myconfig_readonly"?

Prepare for the first module that comes with 1.2.3 version numbering
style (like diagnostic.pm). This includes: print with the help of %vd
unless it looks like a number or "undef". Do the same on PAUSE. If you
read something (either from MM->parse_version or from 02packages) with
>2 dots in it, print it as it is but compare it as v-string. Looks
like I need to abstract all that into a class:-( I've started to
identify a few places where we need changes. Search for %vd. What
makes it a major pain is that we want this to work on old and new
perls.

I have a patch by Jochen Wiedmann that implements a per-distribution
permanent configuration directory. The new containsmods() method in
1.52 should help to fit the patch with the rest of CPAN.pm.

Option to skip testing (Ask Bjoern Hansen).

Default Argument for make,test,look,etc. could be the last argument???

Make a preferred download method configurable (allow further download
methods via plugin?)

Allow different site preferences for index files and other files

Replace make with Make

Maintain the cache at runtime. Currently we only check it at startup.

Determine how to live without CHECKSUM files (e.g. not available)

Distribute compressed CHECKSUM files

Security layer

make plugins configurable, adjust @ISA

Distribute a file with timestamps. Interface could be: 'n 7' for new
arrivals in the last 7 days.

Start documenting the class model

Make configurable that multiple additional index files can be
integrated (for Intra-CPANs). I believe CPAN::Site did it right
anyway, so we might skip this.

Make the 'make' command itself configurable as suggested by Rujith de
Silva <rujith.desilva@ps.net>, who wants to run 'sudo make install'
instead of 'make install'. (Fixing this is delayed, because it
interacts with Make.pm)
