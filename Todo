	* force: I'd expect 'force ls' to always fetch fresh CHECKSUMS
	files. Currently it doesn't.

	* ChangeLog needs to be written by svn during make dist, and the
	dependencies must care for a rerun of 'perl Makefile.PL' when
	CPAN.pm gets edited. This would be 'svn log -r HEAD:131' for the
	ChangeLog, I think.

	* Bug: installing scripts without modules? How does it work? How
	should it work?

	* Bug: installing SWETH/IPv4.pm did not seem to work anymore.
	Fixed in revision 172.

	* Bug: there is a directory ZTANG/Text-PORE-102/ on CPAN with a
	single file README in it. ls chokes on ZTANG because of this. Is
	it a bug that the directory exists or is it a bug that it has no
	CHECKSUMS file?

	* Bug: checksum mismatch on a file is being reported even when the
	file has 0 bytes. 0 bytes should clearly constitute the right/the
	duty to overwrite.

	* Bug: what? we still do not support Build.PL? Didn't anybody send
	me a patch? Try 'install CPAN::Metadata::RDF' and see how this can
	be fixed as quickly as possible.

	Try:        look CPAN::Metadata::RDF
	then there: perl Build.PL;./Build;./Build install

	This does nothing for the prerequisites. We could lookup META.yml
	either then or beforehand.

	* Bug: the nonsense command 'force ls andk' should just do a plain
	'ls andk'. Instead it complains: C<Warning: Cannot ls andk, don't
	know what it is.> FIXED in rev. 180

	* Bug: "o conf foo bar" should complain about invalid key "foo".
	It does instead set "foo" to "bar" and it happened to me to set
	"debug" to "all" and then I wondered why debugging was not turned
	on. Would it have complained, I would have found the correct
	command ("o debug all") much quicker. FIXED in rev. 178.

	* Bug: "reload cpan" does not work if the old and the new CPAN.pm
	have a different path. I installed a new CPAN.pm from CPAN and it
	did remove the old /usr/share/perl/5.8/CPAN.pm but instelled the
	new one as /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.7/CPAN.pm. The reload then
	always just said "0 subroutines redefined".

	* Same effect can be illustrated by changing to the source's root
	directory, running 'perl -Ilib -MCPAN -e shell', 'install
	Tie::CPHash' (or something else???) and then 'reload cpan'....
	Ahhh, this latter example it is a matter of somebody having turned
	off $^W globally:-)...FIXED

	cpan script should accept arguments as suggested by Matt Sergeant:
	   cpan install My::Foo
	
	Cache manager should read youngest directories first and start
	deleting without measuring as soon as the cache limit is reached.
	
	Rename 'o conf' to 'set' and 'o debug' to 'set debug'.
	
	Profiling?
	
	Provide something, so that the next "o conf commit" will not overwrite
	the config file. maybe "myconfig_readonly"?
	
	I have a patch by Jochen Wiedmann that implements a per-distribution
	permanent configuration directory. The new containsmods() method in
	1.52 should help to fit the patch with the rest of CPAN.pm.
	
	Option to skip testing (Ask Bjoern Hansen).
	
	Default Argument for make,test,look,etc. could be the last argument???
	
	Make a preferred download method configurable (allow further download
	methods via plugin?)
	
	Allow different site preferences for index files and other files
	
	Replace make with Make
	
	Maintain the cache at runtime. Currently we only check it at startup.
	
	Distribute compressed CHECKSUM files
	
	Security layer
	
	make plugins configurable, adjust @ISA
	
	Make configurable that multiple additional index files can be
	integrated (for Intra-CPANs). I believe CPAN::Site did it right
	anyway, so we might skip this.
	
	Make the 'make' command itself configurable as suggested by Rujith de
	Silva <rujith.desilva@ps.net>, who wants to run 'sudo make install'
	instead of 'make install'. (Fixing this is delayed, because it
	interacts with Make.pm)
