	https://pause.perl.org:5460/svn/cpanpm/branches/dagolden-cpan-reporter

2006-07-29  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* As #20754 I requested bzip2 support from CPANPLUS. I should write the
	code for mldistwatch so that I just have to turn on the indexing of bz2
	files. DONE in rev 815 of the PAUSE repository.

	* Make the "new -> ." symlink in scripts/ as outlined in a mail to kurt
	and jarkko

	* Todo: add a command to list all scripts and use it to test-install all
	of them to get a good coverage for the new 'install <script>' support.
	DONE in revision 746

2006-07-23  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Todo (E1): use 00whois.xml instead of mailrc, and follow the UTF-8 HOWTO to
	get rid of the term_is_latin variable.

2006-07-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* RT (M5) has 21 open and new tickets...

	* branch 1.87-dbmdeep-hackery revive (H4)? It was very broken but I do not
	remember details. Hint: DBM::Deep promises significant memory savings
	and in that branch we tried to see how it can be made to work for us.

	That brings me to the idea that it would be nice to add these
	build-dependencies into ./blib/bdep or some such idf they are not
	available. I put it on my Todo list.

	* feature request by Juergen Christoffel (M3): have time stamps on the
	history and a history command to see them

	* Bug (E4): it seems that a user who is in /bin and has "." in the
	beginning of the path gets ./sh as his shell from FirstTime. If we
	encounter . in the path we should rather ignore it. But first we must
	verify the behaviour. Reported by Slaven Rezic on behalf of Tino
	Schulze.

	* Todo (E4): investigate what BUGHUNTING in Tarzip means "today".

	* Todo (E3): write a test for dot-cpan/Metadata usage

	* http://www.flight.us/misc/FirstTime.pm_AStrebkov.htm (E3) and
	http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/browse_thread/thread/a3f172fedc02c280/5814e81793793b64#5814e81793793b64
	by Andrew Strebkov makes the URL selection nicer.

	* prerequisites (E3): require perl version xxx: we should not delete that
	information but honour it.

	* RT 17353 (M3): Flag outdated CPAN sites and move them to the end of the
	list when they have reached 291 hours. (Note: $CPAN/authors/02STAMP)

	* Locking (H3): Linda W writes

	>I'm not sure I understand the reason for the lock file
	>placed in cpan_home.  If I have two different architectures
	>with different build directories, I'm not sure I understand

	And I promise to try out a more granular locking mechanism.

	* Jim Cromie suggests (H4): tweak shell to allow cpan> o conf init
	@sections tweak FirstTime::init() interface to accept optional @sections

	put various interactive Qs into groups of conditionals: if ( !@sections
	     or grep /$this_sect_name/, @sections)

	candidate sections: progs - external prog selection make - all make
	options

	* hr ================ no todos below this line ================ /hr

	* How do I merge the branch 1.87-install-scripts into current code base?

	The problem is, I do not remember where the branch started. Is this a
	problem? I have the branches already checked out in ../SVN-branches/.

	There I find the train hackathon result was in 689 and 686 was the copy
	that started the branch.

	So I guess the merge command would have to be

	svn merge -r 686:689 https://pause.perl.org:5460/svn/cpanpm/branches/1.87-install-scripts

	YES, this did it and is now to be checked in as rev. 733

	'install ANDK/keepcool-0.344' works now like a charm, the stored script
	name is even 'keepcool' and not 'keepcool-0.344'.

	  dynamic_config was a major major design mistake, that they got
	  entirely backwards. It relies on authors to not forget to set the
	  dynamic flag, or it results in a failed install.
	  
	  But of course, nobody ever does remember to set it, and we have a huge
	  number of existing modules that don't do this properly.
	  
	  There is no problem at all in us having the requires values considered
	  to be "advisory" only, and then "localize" the dependencies.
	  
	  In short, the flag should have actually been the other way around
	  (i.e. static_config) and so dynamic_config should ALWAYS be 1, unless
	  you have it EXPLICITLY set to 0.
	  
	  We may or may not be able to get the spec revised later on, but in the
	  mean time, dynamic_config should aways be 1 unless you have an
	  explicit 0, not just when there is no requires field.
	  
	  This makes installation potentially a bit slower, and less able to
	  shortcut, but it makes sure that installation remains correct.

	I just tried to make this a Todo item but then checked the code and
	found it bahaves already as Adam suggests. ---> DONE

	* feature request by Martin Sluka: the upgrade command, as described
	further down; to catch the isa_perl issue, we must instantiate a
	Distrostatus object instead of the bare "return" in line 5077. And test
	thoroughly what happens the second time around and later when the user

	Add it to your "requires" hash, that way it will end up in META.yml and
	if people have YAML installed, they can read it.
	
	If people have YAML not installed they will call either the
	Makefile.PL or the Build.PL to hopefully find out what the
	prerequisites are. That way you get the prerequisites but as you have
	noticed, it is too late for your build process.
	
	I don't know how I will fix that. Suggestions welcome. I put it into my
	Todo file.
	
	* Feature request: when asking 'm /svn::notify/', then I would like to

  It would not work for distros, but for modules. Not for bundles either.

  3 states: not installed, not up-to-date, up-to-date  ... space,"<","="

  color codes: green=uptodate, yellow=not uptodate, black=not installed

	DONE in rev. 732

	* upgrade: new command that does nothing but
	CPAN::Shell->install(CPAN::Shell->r)? Do not forget that we still may
	have perl distros in the "r" list. DONE in rev. 727

	* DBM::Deep for a hash behind $CPAN::META. See 2005-12-28 for issues and
	branches/1.80_56plus for a few lines that probably went in the wrong
	direction. Split the loading of Authors/Modules/Distros/Bundles into
	separate pieces and make them lazy. Consider 'reload index', the
	storable Metadata file, readonly/readwrite, changes of the DSLIP thingy,
	offsets into an uncompressed 02xxx file. Remember RT #4943. Remove the

	* Install without {My,}Config.pm, the rules should be:

	if there is no CPAN/MyConfig.pm already loaded, we must try to load a
	CPAN/Config.pm

	if there is no CPAN/Config.pm, we must initialize one immediately. If we
	are root, this should be something like
	/usr/local/perl-5.8.0@27277/lib/5.8.8/CPAN/Config.pm as I just tested it
	with 5.8.8.

	So if root installs CPAN without testing it, they have no CPAN/Config.pm.
	They start it and land immediately in the init process. Good.

	If he runs 'make test' it should succeed all tests. Currently it fails
	12cpan and skips 30shell because of 'no Expect'. ==> TODO. DONE with
	rev. 659

	If they have no CPAN/Config.pm and start cpan as an ordinary user, then
	they should get, without asking, a ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm and land in
	the init dialog. This is currently OK.

	* Todo: mention rt.cpan.org in the manpage. Oops, this was already DONE

	Does not fail with 5.8.8.	Blame? 27059! REPORTED

2006-02-10  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Foreign bug: t/37-translator-graph....Can't locate object method
	"is_trivial_link" via package "GLOB" at
	/home/k/.cpan/build/SQL-Translator-0.07/blib/lib/SQL/Translator/Schema/Graph.pm
	line 46.

	with bleadperl@17102 when trying to test SQL::Translator. Happends on
	blead, not on 5.8.8 but with 5.8.8 I have other (and much more) failures

	With #16852 I have already a ticket there for the signature.

	I regret that I did not include the full command needed to upload one's
	key. Here it is:

    gpg -a --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:11371 --send-keys YOURID

2006-02-08  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: when Running "Makefile.PL" fails, then the case is not reachable
	for the failed routine. Need another Naysayer category?? Try
	Digest-SHA-5.34.tar.gz under perl-5.004_05 before Module::Signature is
	installed. FIXED in rev. 580

2006-02-05  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: RDF::Simple installs although I see failing tests?

	./Build test returns true even if tests fail. This was not always the
	case or was it? No, it wasn't.

	I go into the Class-MethodMaker-2.08 directory and try

	perl Build.PL
	./Build test
	./Build clean

	If Module::Build is missing, I install it manually. No CPAN.pm involved.

	These perls behave (exit 255):

	Stepping in the debugger through bleadperl@27088 and 5.8.8:

	27088 has Test::Harness 2.56 while my 5.8.8 has 2.57_03. Apparently a
	Test::Harness bug. REPORTED as #17490

	* Visit the p5p thread C<replacing "inuse" Win files (was Re: Help with
	a Cwd.pm build error)> for our own cpan.bat. Currently Windows users
	cannot 'reload cpan' when they started the shell from cpan.bat, only
	when they used 'perl -MCPAN -eshell' (David Golden)

	* Feature request: integrate more than one source into a common index.

	* dontload: make a dontload_list and deprecate dontload_hash. It seems
	OK to keep $META->{dontload_hash} but it would be nice if changes on
	$Config->{dontload_list} would always adjust the dontload_hash. DONE in
	rev. 581

	* document and provide a dialog for commandnumber_in_prompt or provide a
	sprintf based solution. Or just leave it as it is. Just like
	inhibit_startup_message.

	* Todo: Write a bunch of distros and upload them with the sole purpose
	of testing CPAN.pm. Also helps Test::Prereq and others.
	PITA::Test::Dummy::Perl5::Make and PITA::Test::Dummy::Perl5::Build? A
	start is done in t/shell.t STARTED around rev. 519

	* Bug: with bleadperl and CPAN 1.83_62 I first install Bundle::CPAN.
	Then I try to install Net::LDAP and answer all questions from
	Module::Install with the default. It then installs Convert::ASN1
	successfully and then says

*** Convert::ASN1 successfully installed.                                       
*** ExtUtils::AutoInstall installation finished.                                
Writing Makefile for Net::LDAP                                                  
make: getcwd: No such file or directory                                         
make[1]: Entering directory `'                                                  
make[1]: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.                 
make[1]: Leaving directory `'                                                   
  /usr/bin/make  -- NOT OK                                                      

	If I now start a new CPAN session, I can install Net::LDAP without problems.

	If I uninstall Convert::ASN1 and start a new CPAN session I can get
	nearly the same result:

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/k/.cpan/build/Convert-ASN1-0.19'
  sudo make install UNINST=1 -- OK
*** Convert::ASN1 successfully installed.
*** ExtUtils::AutoInstall installation finished.
Writing Makefile for Net::LDAP
CPAN: YAML loaded ok
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/k/.cpan/build/perl-ldap-0.33'
make[1]: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/k/.cpan/build/perl-ldap-0.33'
  /usr/bin/make  -- NOT OK

	On the other hand, running same thing on a 5.8.7 with 1.83 succeeds, but
	it asks me if I want to run sudo (and I say no and again no).

	Now I tried bleadperl@27016 with its 1.8359: 'install YAML' then
	'install Net::LDAP' and got the same error.

	Now I try perl-5.8.8-RC1 with its 1.83: it succeeds but asks me again if
	I want to run sudo.

	5.8.8-RC1 with 1.8362: succeeds and asks me if I want to run sudo.

	blead@26447 with 1.8362: error.

	What is it about, the ExtUtils::AutoInstall line? ExtUtils::AutoInstall
	is NOT part of the core. Net::LDAP comes with version 0.59, Audrey has
	reached 0.63.

	I think it goes like so:

	have no perm -> ask sudo -> user says no -> success
	have perm       implicit yes             -> failure

	This is consistent with all of above.... After some more investigation
	reported as bug to Audrey and Graham

2006-01-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Revisit 17313: Module::Build people have promised to write a
	./Build.bat file instead of a ./Build file on Windows. Until this
	becomes true, hide mbuild_install_build_command from Windows users.

2006-01-29  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Foreign bug: broke perl again YAML? blead@26994 fails on test
	dump-perl-types.t of YAML-0.53. Wrote blame report about 26980--DONE

2006-01-27  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Foreign bug: Email::Field or which module was it that just produced
	more than 1000000 eval warnings? Cannot reproduce.

	* bug: if a META.yml specifies a prerequisite module that we do not
	know, the whole prereq_pm became undef. FIXED in rev. 480.

2006-01-26  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: illegal entries in the Config hash are never removed and a hash
	cannot be emptied. The latter is FIXED with rev. 475, the former with
	rev. 476.

	* Bug (Tyler MacDonald): OK, I've figured out what went wrong: 0.27_06
	isn't on www.cpan.org/pub/CPAN yet. However, *how* it went wrong is
	truly bizzare: LWP returned a "404 not found" error, yet somehow I still
	ended up with a .tar.gz and .tar file, and CPAN thinking it had actually
	downloaded something. This looks like a bug in CPAN.pm, both in the 1.7
	version that's distributed with 5.8.7, and the latest release, 1.83.

	In my environment, this comes from curl. After fixing the curl switches,
	the problem persists. This time is lynx to blame, but for lynx there is
	no commandline switch that propagates a 404 to a false. So we now read
	the file that lynx sends us and heuristically decide if it is an error
	message. FIXED in revision 477.

2006-01-25  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: META.yml may contain build_requires which for example File::BOM
	specifies. It doesn't matter that I believe that it is not a
	build_requires, it is really a requires because only tests fail, not the
	build process. But I must merge the two hashes. FIXED in rev. 471

	* Foreign bug: YAML with bleadperl fails a test which succeeds with
	maintperl. REPORTED

	* Bug: with 1.8358 from the core CPAN says after the start
	"lib/CPAN/Config.pm initialized" and goes into the init dialog. After ^C
	I find a lib/CPAN/Config.pm file.

	Ahhh, that's how 'o conf commit' had written my dontload_hash: producing
	a syntax error. FIXED in  rev. 466

2006-01-24  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* 5 new bugs from in RT: 17237 17238 17241 17242 17266

	17237 may be fixed with rev. 464 but not yet tested.

	rev. 465 continued to work on 17237 and I consider it fixed now.

	rev. 467 fixes 17238

	rev. 465 also is an answer to 17241 because this was most likely not a bug

	rev. 469 fixes 17266

	17242 is the request to work with Win32::OLE which I could only reply to
	with 'patches welcome'

	* Bug: setting "o conf dontload_hash ''" breaks the shell: C<Can't use
	string ("") as a HASH ref while "strict refs" in use at lib/CPAN.pm line
	833.> FIXED in rev 464.

2006-01-21  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* see if podlators 2.0.1 fixes the broken README and if so, switch back
	to ${PERL} in the Makefile.PL. FIXED in rev. 457

	* bug: while trying to install Bundle::CPAN, YAML was delayed "until
	after prerequisites" but later was not retried or maybe was retried but
	CPAN said, it was

Running make for I/IN/INGY/YAML-0.53.tar.gz
  Is already unwrapped into directory /home/k/.cpan/build/YAML-0.53
  Delayed until after prerequisites
Running make test
  Delayed until after prerequisites
Running make install
  Delayed until after prerequisites

	So the installation of Bundle::CPAN was not really tried to finish.

	The dependency chain is as follows:

	  YAML depends on Class::Spiffy and Test::Base
    Test::Base depends on Spiffy

	Bug is that ->{later} is not double checked when encountered. Fixed in
	rev. 454.

2006-01-18  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Foreign Bug: RDF::Simple has LWP::UserAgent as undeclared prereq???

	Running make against RDF::Simple pulls in a lot but it finally comes to
	an end. When I then run test, the whole load of modules starts testing
	and three fail their tests:

  ABW/AppConfig-1.56.tar.gz                    : make_test NO
  FLUFFY/Class-MethodMaker-2.08.tar.gz         : make_test NO
  ZOOLEIKA/RDF-Simple-0.22.tar.gz              : make_test NO

	paging back reveals: all the RDF::Simple tests fail due to missing
	LWP::UserAgent, RDF::Simple::Serialiser, and Class::MethodMaker. The
	latter two do not appear when I test against 5.8.8-tobe. REPORTED via
	RT.

	AppConfig fails due to "Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call at
	t/file.t line 112, <DATA> line 69." This is a 5.9.3 issue, we succeed
	with 5.8.8-tobe (@26917) REPORTED via p5p.

	Class-MethodMaker tests fail complaining that they cannot find
	Class::MethodMaker. This is also a 5.9.3 issue. Fully automated binary
	search is impossible unless I find a smaller test case. 26492 ok, 26493
	not ok. Ha! It is a Makefile.PL vs Build.PL issue! On RT #16241 I have
	added this observation.

2006-01-17  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* rt #17089 suggests that we have to care for M:B being installed when
	we find a distro that has only a Build.PL and no Makefile.PL

	AFAIR only CPAN::Metadata::RDF is a module that comes with Build.PL and
	without Makefile.PL, so it is the only one to test the bugreport. This
	takes *quite* a while because of prerequisites (Class::MethodMaker,
	Template::Toolkit, DateTime::TimeZone, DBD::SQLLite, LWP, etc.). And of
	course after all the prerequisites, we HAVE Module::Build, so must
	remove it again. FIXED in rev. 433

	* Foreign Bug? I must investigate DateTime::TimeZone separately. It
	wanted to install Module::Build on its own and then failed giving as a
	reason that Module::Build was not installed???

	It turns out the prereq_pm is undef for some reason. But prereq_pm is
	only built during the 'make' step and then not resetted during a 'force
	get'. The 'prereq_pm_detected' bit is set and I must leave/enter the
	shell to debug this. OK. I see a Makefile.PL that simply fails because
	Module::Build is not installed. At least it says what it wants, but we
	must be better prepared for such an attack. OK, I'll file a bugreport
	against both DateTime::TimeZone and Module::Build -- somebody has to
	confess that it is a prereq and write it into the META.yml. That's what
	I would say. DONE

2006-01-13  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: when ~/.cpan/sources/authors/id/A/AN/ANDK/CPAN-1.83_54.tar.gz is
	not a tar file (because I mistyped a URL and got something else), then
	even "force get ANDK/CPAN-1.83_54.tar.gz" does not overwrite the bogus
	file. The stupid program just keeps complaining that the file is not a
	tarfile and I must remove it manually.

	Ahh, this bug needs not be fixed because it only happens when you have
	no Digest::SHA available. REJECT

	* Bug: $CPAN_config_loaded should be replaced with something like
	$INC{"CPAN/Config.pm"} || $INC{"CPAN/MyConfig.pm"} so that loading one
	of the two before starting the shell will do. Then revert patch 411.
	FIXED in rev. 418

	* Todo: see the newest cpan by brian. DONE (BDFOY/cpan-1.51.tar.gz)

2006-01-12  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: We cannot determine the prereequisites of File::Find::Rule
	because we have no YAML installed and Richard uses Module::Build, so we
	have no Makefile to parse. There is some MB interface to get them. fixed
	in rev. 396

	* Bug: "install Bundle::CPAN Expect Test::Pod" currently failes
	correctly when we reach YAML because we cannot verify the signature. But
	we must not die, we must only set the correct status so the rest of the
	gang can be installed. Fixed in rev. 384

2006-01-11  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* what happens to "failed" when we reload the index? TESTED OK

	* force: I'd expect 'force ls' to always fetch fresh CHECKSUMS
	files. Currently it doesn't. FIXED in rev. 401

	* optimize "ls dowens": currently fetches D/CHECKSUMS and D/DO/CHECKSUMS
	even if we already have D/DO/DOWENS/CHECKSUMS. Is it worth fixing? NO

	* get rid of the summary currently provided by install bundle, its
	superceded by failed(). REJECT, maybe it's useful

	* Todo: document "failed" (and "status"?) DONE for failed, REJECT for status

	* today's rev. 374 of CPAN.pm should be partially reverted: while
	failed() looks good most of the time, it looks ugly that 'force install
	version' installs version and still failed reports:

Writing /usr/local/perl-5.8.0@26774/lib/site_perl/5.9.3/i686-linux-64int/auto/version/vxs/.packlist

  JPEACOCK/version-0.53.tar.gz                 : make_test NO

	Correct behaviour should be that the 'make_test NO' bit be nuked. FIXED
	in rev. 387

	Above that, the "prompt" change was only interesting during debugging.
	Nobody wants to see the internal number of commands in his prompt. FIXED
	in rev. 388

	* Bug: YAML fails to unpack because of bad signature. Retrying leads to
	prereq Test::Base failing due to bad signature. Retrying leads to
	running make test on YAML. dump reveals that somehow SIG_STATUS was set
	to YES. Ahh, that's the signature on the CHECKSUMS file. Need a new
	attribute for broken signatures. FIXED in rev. 374

2006-01-09  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* document CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL DONE

	* find out why Expect is so noisy and when this did start DONE

	* Slaven suggests: How to discover that we are in the subshell?
	Environment? Prompt? Level? PS1 as an environment variable? How does
	Debian's apt-get solve that? HALF-DONE in rev. 360: We now have the
	envariable CPAN_SHELL_LEVEL but I'd still like to make a change to the
	prompt. Update: Debian does not mangle the prompt, they just say 'Type
	exit when you're done':

	* Rename Releasenotes to Changes and make the ChangeLog in the
	traditional format, there is some XSLT stylesheet somewhere that does
	this. Ah here: http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/svn2cl-0.5.tar.gz
	DONE up to rev. 352

2006-01-01  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Give every command a number and store that number in the object,
	something like incommandcolor but without removing it at the end of the
	command. With such a number we can make failed(commandnumber) filter on
	that commandnumber and have instant per-command-failed. DONE in rev 374

2005-12-31  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: I install Archive::Extract and it has the prerequisite
	Module::Load::Conditional declared but nobody installs it.
	FIXED in rev. 329

2005-12-30  Andreas J Koenig  <akoenig@cellular.de>

	* FirstTime needs a structure over each question or questiongroup so
	that we can ask single questions. Structure was brought by Jim Comie
	around rev. 355

	* Bug: "reload cpan" does not work if the old and the new CPAN.pm
	have a different path. I installed a new CPAN.pm from CPAN and it
	did remove the old /usr/share/perl/5.8/CPAN.pm but installed the
	new one as /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.7/CPAN.pm. The reload then
	always just said "0 subroutines redefined". FIXED in rev. 321

	* rev 315 fixed a path/permission problem with the use of basename() and
	I could see that the error message gets much better than before but we
	need a test case that shows that this strategy can really work in some
	cases. Maybe we need to store the tar file somewhere else to keep the
	tmp/ directory tidy. Also we must see what happens when we cannot remove
	the tmp/ directory. The list of broken distros in
	eg/find-module-install-sudo-bugs.pl will help. DONE

	* add eg/ to the MANIFEST? Not yet, the script is too much focused on a
	problem that is not of interest to others. REJECT

	* Bug: checksum mismatch on a file is being reported even when the
	file has 0 bytes. 0 bytes should clearly constitute the right/the
	duty to overwrite. FIXED in rev. 320

2005-12-29  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug suspected in Module::Install: it seems to run CPAN.pm in a
	subshell with sudo and so we get directories under build/ that we do not
	own. No release before this bug is traced down! Bugreport sent to Audrey
	a few minutes ago (already Friday, 0:30 Berlin time). Bug confirmed and
	has already been fixed in 0.37 and old distros must be redistroed. DONE

	* branching and merging: make current HEAD a branch "1.80_56plus" and
	roll HEAD back to contain only the zero-risk stuff (for maybe later
	releasing that as 1.81?) DONE

2005-12-21  Andreas J Koenig  <akoenig@cellular.de>

	* complete 'o conf' does not show commit. FIXED in rev 291

	* Bug: Module::Install writes into META.yml "perl: 5.004" and we take it
	as a Module requirement. Whose bug? WORKAROUND in rev 290

	* Can't locate object method "prettyprint" via package "CPAN::Config" at

	* switch back and forth between preferring Build.PL or Makefile.PL; find
	12 modules that are good for testing Module::Build:

	SVN::Notify::Mirror  failed a test with "could not exec svnnotify" but it
                       worked on the commandline

	SVN::Notify::Config  is the whole family of SVN::Notify a mess, dependency-wise?

	SVN::Notify          must be installed first???

	Text::Lorem HTTP::Proxy Workflow Calendar::Simple DateTime::HiRes
	CGI::Wiki::Kwiki Class::Container HTML::TagCloud
	Data::FormValidator::Util::HTML

	DONE for rev 269

2005-12-15  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: what? we still do not support Build.PL? Didn't anybody send
	me a patch? Try 'install CPAN::Metadata::RDF' and see how this can
	be fixed as quickly as possible.

	Try:        look CPAN::Metadata::RDF
	then there: perl Build.PL;./Build;./Build install

	This does nothing for the prerequisites. We could lookup META.yml either
	then or beforehand. FIXED although only minimal tested in rev 269

	* YAML for dependency checking in rev 268

	* bz2 support: testobject is ARTURAZ/Net-Vypress-Chat-0.72.1.tar.bz2
	DONE in rev 264

	* Todo: sha256 DONE in rev 263

	* Todo: 4th colmn in the 'r' command has not the canonical name
	but the unneeded D/DC/ stuff. DONE in rev 262.

	* Globbing on the ls command: completion? REJECTED

2005-12-12  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Feature request: if I type 'm CGI:Session' (note the missing second
	colon) I get

	No objects of type Module found for argument CGI:Session

	I believe, CPAN could supply the missing colon in this case. DONE

2005-11-30  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: when the Metadata file has been read with the old version and
	CPAN reads the new index it does not update the version. Witness
	Crypt::Khazad. Once the Metadata are removed completely and built up
	correctly, everything is OK.

	Can be tested by running

	!print $CPAN::META->{readonly}{"CPAN::Module"}{"Crypt::Khazad"}{"CPAN_VERSION"} = "1.0"
	reload index

	This may have nothing to do with multidot versions, just some
	pessimization in the code dealing with replacement of META when
	re-reading index files. FIXED

2005-11-22  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* From: David Golden <david@hyperbolic.net>:

	> Also, "lack of distname support" is overblowing the situation.
	> Distnames are supported perfectly fine as long as you put it in the
	> proper syntax with author's ID and version.
	
	I think the problem Jim encountered is that "proper syntax" is part of
	the arcana of CPAN.  It's not obvious from the help:
	
	>  a,b,d,m  WORD or /REGEXP/  about authors, bundles, distributions, modules
	>  i        WORD or /REGEXP/  about anything of above
	>  r        NONE              reinstall recommendations
	>  ls       AUTHOR            about files in the author's directory
	
	Something that clarifies that AUTHOR/DIST-VERSION is a valid format
	would help.  Or rather, some specific example of what that WORD can be:
	
	  where WORD is either a module, bundle or author name or a
	  distribution name of the form AUTHOR/DISTRIBUTION-VERSION
	
	It's vaguely alluded to in the CPAN perldoc, but only in the section
	describing the four CPAN::* classes.
	
	A doc patch would be a quick fix for this.

	* globbing on the ls command: only ls 'GBARR/Scalar*', or even 'ls
	*/makepatch'? 2005-12-12: DONE 

	* script to copy relevant files to the perl tree. DONE

2005-11-04  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* is version in script/cpan OK? It was 1.3 in perl @25981! Same
	for Nox.pm FIXED

	* PAUSE key 2005? DONE

2005-11-03  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Need Releasenotes, the ChangeLog is a big mess with the numerous
	checkins that all were just testing the release cycle itself and
	not generating anything useful for the user. DONE

2005-11-02  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: why did the release only contain a ChangeLog up to release
	206 when we were at 212? Ah, I see, the disttest target does not
	make a to-be-released file, must be done by make dist. So the
	whole release was @206. No harm done because between 206 and 212 I
	only worked on the release target. I think I need a disttest of my
	own that takes the dist.tar.gz already built and tests it, not the
	one that builds a dist from the air again into the air and tests
	that. I want a real test of that file that is going to be
	released. Then I can live with 'make release' running both dist
	and disttest. I think. DONE
	
	* Bug: as a non-root user and first-time caller (no ~/.cpan/
	directory) I said "not ready for interactive configuration" and
	then said 'o conf init'. I got no questions asked but into a fast
	endless loop like so:

(1) Africa
(2) Asia
(3) Central America
(4) Europe
(5) North America
(6) Oceania
(7) South America
Select your continent (or several nearby continents) []

Sorry! since you don't have any existing picks, you must make a
geographic selection.

	until I hot ^C. *Very* Clever tricks with prompt?

	Reproducable as described. Leaving the shell and entering it again
	make it not reproducable. I must 'rm -rf ~/.cpan
	lib/CPAN/Config.pm' to reproduce. FIXED in rev 214

	* cpan> m Apache::AuthAny 
	Can't call method "upload_date" on an undefined value at /usr/perl-5.8.4/lib/5.8.4/CPAN.pm line 5761.

	FIXED in rev 186.

	* Slaven suggests a variable "permanently_connected" that helps to
	decide if a connection to the internet is available. Do ask the
	community if people care about such stuff. Slaven expects, some
	will care that the the 'm' and 'd' commands now make a connection
	to the internet. FIXED by introducing do_ls_on_m_and_d.

2005-10-20  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* ChangeLog needs to be written by svn during make dist, and the
	dependencies must care for a rerun of 'perl Makefile.PL' when
	CPAN.pm gets edited. This would be 'svn log -r HEAD:131' for the
	ChangeLog, I think. FIXED

2005-10-18  Andreas J. Koenig  <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de>

	* Bug: installing SWETH/IPv4.pm did not seem to work anymore.
	FIXED in revision 172.

	* Bug: there is a directory ZTANG/Text-PORE-102/ on CPAN with a
	single file README in it. ls chokes on ZTANG because of this. Is
	it a bug that the directory exists or is it a bug that it has no
	CHECKSUMS file? FIXED by simply removing the README file from
	CPAN.

2005-10-12  Andreas J Koenig  <akoenig@cellular.de>

	* Bug: the nonsense command 'force ls andk' should just do a plain
	'ls andk'. Instead it complains: C<Warning: Cannot ls andk, don't
	know what it is.> FIXED in rev. 180

2005-10-11  Andreas J Koenig  <akoenig@cellular.de>

	* Bug: "o conf foo bar" should complain about invalid key "foo".
	It does instead set "foo" to "bar" and it happened to me to set
	"debug" to "all" and then I wondered why debugging was not turned
	on. Would it have complained, I would have found the correct
	command ("o debug all") much quicker. FIXED in rev. 178.

	* Same effect can be illustrated by changing to the source's root
	directory, running 'perl -Ilib -MCPAN -e shell', 'install
	Tie::CPHash' (or something else???) and then 'reload cpan'....
	Ahhh, this latter example it is a matter of somebody having turned
	off $^W globally:-)...FIXED

2003-08-13  Andreas J Koenig

	cpan script should accept arguments as suggested by Matt Sergeant:
	   cpan install My::Foo
	
	Cache manager should read youngest directories first and start
	deleting without measuring as soon as the cache limit is reached.
	
	Rename 'o conf' to 'set' and 'o debug' to 'set debug'.
	
	Profiling?
	
	Provide something, so that the next "o conf commit" will not overwrite
	the config file. maybe "myconfig_readonly"?
	
	I have a patch by Jochen Wiedmann that implements a per-distribution
	permanent configuration directory. The new containsmods() method in
	1.52 should help to fit the patch with the rest of CPAN.pm.
	
	Option to skip testing (Ask Bjoern Hansen).
	
	Default Argument for make,test,look,etc. could be the last argument???
	
	Make a preferred download method configurable (allow further download
	methods via plugin?)
	
	Allow different site preferences for index files and other files
	
	Replace make with Make
	
	Maintain the cache at runtime. Currently we only check it at startup.
	
	Distribute compressed CHECKSUM files
	
	Security layer
	
	make plugins configurable, adjust @ISA
	
	Make configurable that multiple additional index files can be
	integrated (for Intra-CPANs). I believe CPAN::Site did it right
	anyway, so we might skip this.
	
	Make the 'make' command itself configurable as suggested by Rujith de
	Silva <rujith.desilva@ps.net>, who wants to run 'sudo make install'
	instead of 'make install'. (Fixing this is delayed, because it
	interacts with Make.pm)
