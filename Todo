Make a preferred download method configurable (allow further download
methods via plugin?)

Allow different site preferences for index files and other files

Replace tar, gzip, and make with Archive::Tar, Compress::Zlib, and
Make

Determine how to live without CHECKSUM files (e.g. not available)

Distribute compressed CHECKSUM files

Security layer

make plugins configurable, adjust @ISA

Distribute a file with timestamps. Interface could be: 'n 7' for new
arrivals in the last 7 days.

Start documenting the class model

Make configurable that multiple additional index files can be
integrated (for Intra-CPANs)

Make DSLI more meaningful to reflect the availablity in CPAN (D-entry
uppercase if module available on CPAN)

Make the 'make' command itself configurable as suggested by Rujith de
Silva <rujith.desilva@ps.net>, who wants to run 'sudo make install'
instead of 'make install'. (Fixing this is delayed, because it
interacts with Make.pm)

Parse the output of 'perl Makefile.PL' for warnings from PREREQ_PM and
react accordingly (my favorite feature request by Randal). This might
become a (too?) big endeavour if we extend that to third party
software.

I should study RPM. Too bad it doesn't work *at all* on my Linux box.
RPM gurus are welcome to help me. I just don't enjoy software that
doesn't work out of the box on my own box :-(

Make the FirstTime dialog more Absolutely-First-Time-Without-Any-Clue
style. Thanks to Mike Heins for providing me with insights how users
feel when they haven't heard of CPAN ever before. Offering
autodetermination of a CPAN site might help. Offering something like a
Configure -des might help. Still thinking.
