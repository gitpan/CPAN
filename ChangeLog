	  strings

	* Todo, lib/CPAN.pm: although "force ls" still does not force an 
	  immediate new read of the checksum files, we now can at least 
	  say "force ls FOO/B*": before this gave us a horrible error

	  t/Nox.t, t/loadme.t, t/mirroredby.t, t/signature.t, t/vcmp.t, 
	  t/version.t: 	* Shame, two years without a release. Most of the 
	  code in this
	  	release has been collected by perl5porters over the last two
	  	years. Thanks a lot to all of them. The whole Module::Signature
	  	code has been written by Autrijus two years ago and I have to
	  	apologize that I didn't make a release with it. Real life was
	  	intruding too strongly.
	  
	  	I have made cautious changes to the version comparison 
	  functions,
	  	anticipating the likely changes we're gonna see with a better
	  	indexer on CPAN courtesy John Peacock.
	  
	  	I'm releasing 1.76_51 as an orientation for CPANPLUS so we can
	  	find the smoothest transition possible between the old and the 
	  new
	  	indexer.
	  
	  	The new indexer will be based on version.pm 0.48 and will bring
	  	the substantial change that all modules that are using version
	  	strings will be represented as floats according to the 
	  conversion
	  	routine implemented in version.pm. Up to now the conversion from
	  	version strings to floats was lossy but with the new version.pm 
	  it
	  	is a well defined 1 to 1 mapping. See version.pm for the 
	  details.
	  
	  	To make the transition smoother, I'm intending to leave the
	  	indexer with the old algorithm for all strings that look like
	  	floating point numbers, and for other strings that contain an
	  	underline character or alphabetical stuff.
	  
	  	Future plans: once we have rolled out the version related 
	  changes,
	  	I'm planning to fix open bugs and integrate waiting patches that
	  	have not yet made their way into CPAN.pm.
